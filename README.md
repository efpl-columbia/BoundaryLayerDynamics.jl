*Turbulence-resolving simulations of boundary-layer flows.*

BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl can simulate a range of physical problems, but its primary purpose is to simulate the evolution of turbulent flows in simplified representations of the [atmospheric boundary layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer).
It can be used to perform [direct numerical simulation (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_numerical_simulation) and [large-eddy simulation (LES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_eddy_simulation) of flows in channel-like geometries.
A detailed description of the physical and mathematical models is provided in [the documentation](https://docs.mfsch.dev/BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl/) and in [a preprint](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1071) describing the code.

## Documentation

[![Online Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ•®-Online_Documentation-2C6BAC)](https://docs.mfsch.dev/BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl/)

The documentation in the `docs` folder relies on [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) and can be accessed [online](https://docs.mfsch.dev/BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl/) or by building it locally.
Run `just makedocs` build the documentation, or `just servedocs` to serve and automatically rebuild the documentation using [LiveServer.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl).
If you donâ€™t have [`just`](https://just.systems/) installed, you can also manually run the commands in the [`justfile`](./.justfile).
