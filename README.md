*Turbulence-resolving simulations of boundary-layer flows.*

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ•®-Documentation-4063d8)](https://docs.mfsch.dev/BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl/)

BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl can simulate a range of physical problems, but its
primary purpose is to simulate the evolution of turbulent flows in simplified
representations of the [atmospheric boundary layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer).
It can be used to perform [direct numerical simulation (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_numerical_simulation) and [large-eddy simulation (LES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_eddy_simulation) of flows in channel-like geometries.
A detailed description of the physical and mathematical models is provided in [the documentation](https://docs.mfsch.dev/BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl/).

## Documentation

The documentation in the `docs` folder relies on
[Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) and can be accessed [online](https://docs.mfsch.dev/BoundaryLayerDynamics.jl/) or by building it locally.

To build the documentation, run `julia docs/make.jl`.
This will create the HTML documentation in the `docs/build` directory.
The `make.jl` script takes care of setting up the package environment so it can be run
from anywhere as long as it has access to `Pkg` from the standard library.

To work on the documentation, it is recommended to use
[LiveServer.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl).
If it is installed in the global environment, a development server can be
launched with `julia -e 'using LiveServer; servedocs()'` from the project root.
